Perhaps one of the most important and fundamental decisions is how to render our web application when we start architecting a
new web app. That‚Äôs why today I want to talk about two ways of rendering, **client-side rendering** and **server-side rendering**.Of course,
these two patterns are not the only ones, and we will discuss progressive rendering and other patters in the near future.



## Terminology I will use üí¨

### üé® Rendering

-  __SSR__ = Server-Side Rendering ‚Äî rendering a client-side or universal app to HTML on the server.
-  __CSR__ = Client-Side Rendering ‚Äî rendering an app in a browser, generally using the DOM.
-  __Rehydration__ - booting up JavaScript views on the client such that they reuse the server-rendered HTML‚Äôs DOM tree and data.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Performance

- __FP__  = First Paint ‚Äî the first time any pixel becomes visible to the user.
- __FCP__ = First Contentful Paint ‚Äî the time when requested content (article body, etc) becomes visible.
- __TTI__ = Time To Interactive ‚Äî the time at which a page becomes interactive (events wired up, etc).
- __TTFB__ = Time to First Byte ‚Äî the time between entering a link and the first bit of content coming in


Let‚Äôs start with __CSR__. In such a rendering process, we have almost the empty html, and the the builded Javascript.
 We are generating and building the Dom by loading this JS code into the browser.

# CSR 

## Structure ‚õ©Ô∏è üèóÔ∏è:

Consider we have HTML with an empty div tag and bundled js on the server. CSR rendering looks like this:

![animation](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/1*fK3CMzW1QNvNQGyH82PTYg.gif)

The HTML consists of just a single root div tag and all the other things like displaying and updating the DOM are handled by JS.

## üöÄ Bundles and Performance

If we think about the performance, we first see that as the complexity of the page increase, the complexity and size of JS will increase as 
well and the time to get it from the server will increase. That will cause a delay for the FCP and TTI of the page.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Pros and Cons

### Pros: ‚úÖ

- CSR provides a way to have SPA that supports pages to navigate without refreshing. This was a big deal for a long time and now it‚Äôs possible for websites to start acting like dynamic applications.

### Cons: ‚ùå

There are a few pitfalls though:
 - __Performance__. As the complexity of the page increase we have to wait more for JS to see the FCP.
 - __SEO__. Just like user visitors, bots make requests to view the page. This is well known process as crawling. During the first 
stage Googlebots crawling the source code of your page and indexes all the visible (`non javascript`) content. But we have nothing visible
until the JS is executed to build the dom. During this rendering phase he will come again( `sometimes that time goes to months`) and now getting the real content of your page available for crawling and eventually adding it to the index.

/>

Since performance issues are caused by the Javascript bundle size there are some approaches that improve the performance of CSR.
 - __Lazy-Loading__. With lazy loading, we can avoid loading non-critical resources. This approach will reduce the initial page load time.
 - __Agressive Code Splitting__.It helps us to create multiple bundles that can be loaded dynamically during runtime. 
It also enables us to lazy load JS resources. Code splitting is supported by bundlers like [__Turbopack__](https://turbo.build/)
or [__Webpack__](https://webpack.js.org/).

 - __Caching with service workers__. It can be used to cache the application shell offline and increase the performance time.

# Server-Side Rendering


Let‚Äôs take a look what is SSR. It‚Äôs the oldest method to generate the full HTML for the page content to be rendered during the
user makes a request. For this implementation we need to build the html on the server side and send it to the browser so the browser 
can easily build a FCP.


![ssr-gif](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*ijZNzXjr2m1ipr9oae8eDw.gif)

The browser makes a request on the server and gets the HTML not just empty root but also generated with the content in it. 
So the browser shows the content as soon as it‚Äôs possible. Now the browser starts downloading your bundle, and the user still sees the 
content on the screen but it‚Äôs not interactive yet. Only after your bundle is downloaded, it attach event listeners to your HTML and becomes
 interactive. This process we call __hydration__ or __rehydration__.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Pros and Cons

### Pros: ‚úÖ

Less Javascript enables the browser for quicker `FCP` and `TTI`.

<Image
  alt={`SSR Performace`}
  src={`/images/csr-and-ssr-rendering/ssr-performance.webp`}
  width={1065}
  height={557}
/>

Since we are avoiding sending lots of Javascript to the Client FCP and users are just waiting for TTI. 
When we have lots of UI elements on the page SSR has way less JS than CSR so the time to get the scripts is lesser even 
if sometimes we have __FP=FCP=TTI.__

- __SEO__ . Search engine bots are getting the content easily on the first stage so they now can index the page. So we now that we are 
getting quite good SEO on the page.

### Cons: ‚ùå

Sometimes we may have a slow __TTFB__. That would be a scenario when the user has a Slow network or the Server code is not optimized.

Since all our code is not available on the client side then the frequent calls to the server cause full page reloads and sometimes 
this will increase the time between interactions. Thus SPA is not possible with SSR.

__Let‚Äôs create simple React SSR app with Express.__

---

### Step: 1

Create React application

```bash title="bash"
npx create-react-app ssr-react
```

### Step: 2

Remove extra files in __src__ folder and just left __App.js and index.js__.

### Step: 3

Let‚Äôs write component : counter with increase and decrease methods.


```js title="src/App.js"

import React, { useState } from 'react';

const App = ({ initialValue }) => {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);
	if (typeof window === 'undefined') return <></>;
	return (
	  <>
		<div className="App">
			<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
			<div style={{ margin: "20px" }}>{count}</div>
			<button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrease</button>
		</div>
	  </>
	);
};

export default App;

```

### Step: 4

Now we want to render it server side. First we need a server so create a new folder server and add the Server.js file into it. 
I will use express to create a server, let‚Äôs install it first.

```bash title="bash"
npm i express --save
```

Create a express server and listen it on port 3000.

```js title="server/server.js"
import express from 'express';
const app = express();

app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log('server running on 3000');
});
```

### Step: 5

No we have a server. What we need is to get the builded html file. We will render the App component and pass it to the response. 
We need to serve out statice files as well.

```js title="server/server.js"
import express from 'express';
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import App from '../src/App';
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server';
const app = express();

app.get("/page", async (req, res) => {
  fs.readFile(path.resolve("./build/index.html"), "utf-8", (err, data) => {
	
	if (err) {
	  return res.status(500).send("Error happened");
	}

	const html = `<div id="root">${ReactDOMServer.renderToString(
		<App />
	)}</div>`;

	return res.send(data.replace('<div id="root"></div>', html));
  });
});

app.use(express.static(path.resolve(\_\_dirname, "..", "build")));

app.listen(3000, function () {
console.log("server running on 3000");
});

```

### Step:6

So we read __index.html__ file from the built folder. Then we need to render the __App__ component on the server side, for this, we use __ReactDOMServer__ which provides the method to render the component on the server side. 
Replace the empty div root with our rendered component da send it to the client.
So we are using __JSX__ on the server side and need support for it, so we need to add Babel for it.

```bash
npm i @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react @babel/register ignore-styles --save-dev
```

### Step: 7

Add __index.js__ file side by __server.js__ and require these things into it and require __server.js__ on bottom of them.

```js title="server/index.js"
require("ignore-styles");

require("@babel/register")({
    ignore: [/(node_module)/],
    presets: ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"],
});

require("./server");

```

### Step: 8
On the frontend side, we don‚Äôt need __ReactDOM.render__ anymore since we have already rendered the __DOM__ from the server and now we need to 
__hydrate__ it to register event listeners and etc. Now __index.js__ on the __src__ folder looks like this.

```js title="src/index.js"
import React, { StrictMode } from "react";
import { hydrateRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

hydrateRoot(document.getElementById("root"), <App initialValue={10} />);
```

### Step: 9

Add the final run command in package.json file:

```json
    "ssr": "node server/index.js",
```

The first build our frontend by the command __npm run build__ and then start our server by the command __npm run ssr__.
