## What is a Monad❓


A monad is a programming concept that is used in functional programming languages. 
The main idea is to encapsulate computations that contain side effects
. A monad can be considered as a container or wrapper that stores some value and has 
methods to transform or compose it into some computations sequentially. 
To sum up, It is a design pattern that is used to encapsulate and sequence computations, 
and it is often used to manage side effects in functional programming languages.


## What is a side effect?

Imagine that you are a child again. You are in the garden again and you are standing in 
front of a toy box with lots of toys: 🐣,🪱,🚨,🏍️,🎤. Each of them has its unique ability 
some make sounds, some light up, some move and some sing. Now let’s say you want to play 
with one of the toys, but when you take it out of the box and play with it, it affects other 
toys in the box. Maybe the toy makes a noise that startles the other toys, or maybe it moves 
around and knocks into other toys. This effect, in programming, we call a side effect, For adult children 🦾.
It’s like a toy that has a special power that can affect other toys around it.

Let’s bring examples of **_side effects_** that we understand:
 - [x]  **Making a network request**
 - [x]  **Updating a database record**
 - [x]  **Modifying the content of a file**

## The idea of a Monads

The main idea of a Monad is to manage these side effects. This is a way of dealing with side effects
in a consistent and predictable way so that the functions they use can be composed and combined with each other.
It is a kind of container, a wrapper for some values. When we use a monad, we store some values in the monad, 
and we can already do some operations on those values with the methods we describe in the monad.

Here are some specific methods that follow the monadic structure:

 1. __unit__ or __just__ or __return__: This method takes a value and wraps it in the monad, 
    creating a new instance of the monad. It's also called __pure__ or __of__ in some languages.
 2. __flatMap__ or __bind__ or __chain__: This method applies a function to the value inside the 
    monad and returns a new instance of the monad. It's used to chain multiple operations on the same monad. For example, the __Promise__ object has a method then() that applies a function to the resolved value and returns a new instance of the Promise monad.
 3. __map__: This method applies a function to the value inside the monad and returns a new instance of 
    the monad with the transformed value. It's used to transform the value without unwrapping and re-wrapping it. 
	For example, the Array object has a method map() that applies a function to each element in the array and returns a 
	new instance of the Array monad with the transformed elements.

## Talk is cheap. Show me the code.

### Example 1: SafeDivide

After the theoretical talk, let’s see an example of how it works.
I created a monad called __Maybe__ that represents a value that may or may not be present. (__null__)

```typescript title="Maybe.ts"
class Maybe {
	constructor(value) {
	  this.value = value;
	}

	static just(value) {
	  return new Maybe(value);
	}

	static nothing() {
	  return new Maybe(null);
	}

	isNotValid() {
	  return this.value === null || this.value === undefined;
	}
	map(fn) {
	  if (this.isNotValid()) {
	   	return Maybe.nothing();
	  } else {
	   	return Maybe.just(fn(this.value));
	  }
	}

	chain(fn) {
	  if (this.isNotValid()) {
		return Maybe.nothing();
	  } else {
		return fn(this.value);
	  }
	}

	getOrElse(defaultValue) {
	  if (this.isNotValid()) {
	    return defaultValue;
	  } else {
	    return this.value;
	  }
	}
}
```

Let’s walk through this implementation. I have a __Maybe__, a monad that has a __value property__ that represents the value represented by the monad.
In addition, I have the following methods:

- __just__ — static method, creates and returns a new Maybe monad based on the value passed.
- __nothing__ — static method, creates and returns a new Maybe monad with no value (null).
- __isNotValid__ — checks whether the value returned by the monad is invalid.
- __map__ — is passed to a function: __fn__ and depending on whether the monad pointer is valid or not, applies 
  this function to the monad’s current value and returns a new monad with the new value.
- __chain__ — is passed to a function: __fn__ and if the monad value is valid, applies this function to the current monad value 
  and returns a new monad __fn(this.value)__.
- __getOrElse__ — is passe defaultValue, which will return if the current monad value is invalid.

Let’s use this monad now. Let’s write a __safeDivide__ function, which will accept __dividend__ and __divisor__ and return __dividend/divisor__.
We will wrap it in the monad to avoid the side effect. In this case, the only side effect would be division by 0.


```ts title="safeDivide.ts"
// Define a function that returns a Maybe monad
function safeDivide(dividend, divisor) {
  if (divisor === 0) {
    return Maybe.nothing();
  } else {
    return Maybe.just(dividend / divisor);
  }
}
```

Let us explain. If the __divisor__ is 0, no division is possible and we return a new __monad__ with __no value__, otherwise, 
we return a monad **_Maybe(dividend/divisor)_** with a new value.

Let’s look at a concrete example, and it will lead to a chain of several operations.

```ts title='test.ts'
// Use the Maybe monad to sequence operations that involve division
const result = Maybe.just(2)
	.chain(x => safeDivide(10, x))
	.chain(x => safeDivide(100, x));

// Extract the value from the Maybe monad
console.log(result.getOrElse('Error: division by zero')); // Output: 25
```

We took a new monad that initially held the value 2, and called the __chain__ method twice, passing a function that returned the monad itself.

- __chain I__ - x = 2,  and __safeDivide__(10,x)__ would return the new monad __Maybe(5)__.
- __chain II__ — the chain function will be called for __Maybe(5) Monad__, corresponding to x = 5. __safeDivide(100,5)__ will be called and the 
  new monad __Maybe(25)__ will be returned.

Finally, we log __result.getOrElse__ and try to __extract the wrapped value__ of the returned Maybe. If it is __null__, let’s output the corresponding message.


## Example 2: List of users from the database

Imagine you want to retrieve a list of users from the database. This function can be disabled if an error occurred during a connection to the database or if the query fails.
Come on, let’s put it in Monad and handle the side effects that way.

```ts title='database.ts'

// Assume this function could fail due to a network error or other issue
const getUsers = () => {
	const users = [
		{ name: 'Alice', email:'alice@example.com' },
		{ name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@example.com' },
		{ name: 'Charlie', email: 'charlie@example.com' }
	];
	return new Maybe(users);
}

// Retrieve the users and extract their names
const names = getUsers()
	.map(users => users.map(user => user.name))
	.getOrElse([]);

console.log(names);
// Output: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
```

Since we don’t know if __getUsers()__ will return a list or it will fail, we should wrap its return value in a monad and
return it like __Maybe(users)__.

On it, we can already call __.map__ method which in turn looks and manages whether the value on which we want to call the callback 
function exists or not. It returns either __Maybe(null)__ or __Maybe(['Alice', 'Bob', ’Charlies'])__.

Finally, with __getOrElse([])__ we will try to open and __extract the wrapped value__ returned by __Maybe Monad__, and if it doesn’t exist, 
return an empty list.

Thanks for your attention!
